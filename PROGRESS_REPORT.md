# MCP Atlassian Issue Resolution Progress Report

## Executive Summary
This document tracks the comprehensive analysis and resolution of critical failures in the MCP Atlassian project, specifically addressing 0% success rates for JIRA comments, ADF format issues, and HTTP 415 errors for file attachments.

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete - Critical Bug Identified

**Overall Progress: 50% Complete (4/8 phases)**

### Key Findings
1. **ADF Serialization Issue**: ✅ **ALREADY RESOLVED** - FormattingMixin now correctly returns ADF dict objects instead of JSON strings
2. **Content-Type Header Conflict**: ❌ **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED** - Requires immediate fix

## Detailed Analysis Results

### Phase 1-3: Infrastructure Analysis (Complete)
- ✅ Confirmed sophisticated ADF formatting infrastructure exists
- ✅ Validated architectural soundness of the integration chain
- ✅ Identified that the system has proper layering and abstractions

### Phase 4: Root Cause Debugging (Complete)

#### Critical Discovery: Content-Type Header Conflict
**Location**: `src/mcp_atlassian/rest/jira_v3.py:763-767`

**Root Cause**: The `add_attachment()` method has a critical bug where it doesn't remove the conflicting `"Content-Type": "application/json"` header set by the BaseRESTClient when uploading files.

**Current Code (Broken)**:
```python
response = self.session.post(
    f"{self.base_url}/rest/api/3/issue/{issue_key}/attachments",
    files=files,
    headers={"X-Atlassian-Token": "no-check"},
)
```

**Problem**: BaseRESTClient automatically sets `"Content-Type": "application/json"` in session headers (lines 89-94 in `src/mcp_atlassian/rest/base.py`), but file uploads require `multipart/form-data` which conflicts with the JSON content type, causing HTTP 415 errors.

#### ADF Serialization Status: Already Fixed
**Location**: `src/mcp_atlassian/jira/formatting.py:101-103`

The FormattingMixin correctly returns ADF dict objects:
```python
# Handle ADF dict objects for Cloud instances
if isinstance(result, dict):
    # FIXED: Always return ADF dict for Cloud instances
    # JiraV3Client.add_comment() expects dict objects, not JSON strings
    return result
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: Solution Architecture (Next)
**Target**: Design the specific fix for the Content-Type header conflict

**Solution Design**:
```python
# FIXED VERSION - Override conflicting Content-Type header
response = self.session.post(
    f"{self.base_url}/rest/api/3/issue/{issue_key}/attachments",
    files=files,
    headers={
        "X-Atlassian-Token": "no-check",
        "Content-Type": None  # Let requests set multipart/form-data automatically
    },
)
```

### Phase 6: Implementation (Pending)
- Apply the Content-Type header fix to `src/mcp_atlassian/rest/jira_v3.py`
- Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality

### Phase 7: Validation & Testing (Pending)
- Test attachment uploads with real API calls
- Verify HTTP 415 errors are resolved
- Confirm multipart/form-data is properly set

### Phase 8: Quality Assurance & Delivery (Pending)
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Document the resolution
- Verify no regressions in comment functionality

## Key Files and Locations

### Files Requiring Changes
- **`src/mcp_atlassian/rest/jira_v3.py`** (Line 766): Apply Content-Type header fix

### Files Already Correct
- **`src/mcp_atlassian/jira/formatting.py`** (Lines 101-103): ADF serialization working correctly
- **`src/mcp_atlassian/servers/jira.py`** (Lines 986-1007): MCP tool integration working correctly

### Key Implementation Details
- **BaseRESTClient** (`src/mcp_atlassian/rest/base.py:89-94`): Sets default JSON headers
- **JiraV3Client.add_comment()** (`src/mcp_atlassian/rest/jira_v3.py:241-268`): Properly wraps ADF in data structure
- **FormattingMixin.markdown_to_jira()** (`src/mcp_atlassian/jira/formatting.py:74-116`): Returns correct ADF dict format

## Technical Context

### ADF (Atlassian Document Format) Infrastructure
The project has comprehensive ADF support including:
- AST-based markdown-to-ADF conversion using mistune
- Format routing system with deployment type detection
- Plugin architecture for extensible ADF node support
- Performance optimization with caching and size limits

### Integration Chain Analysis
```
FastMCP Server → FormattingMixin → JiraV3Client → BaseRESTClient → Jira API
     ✅              ✅              ❌                ✅           HTTP 415
```

Only the Content-Type header handling in JiraV3Client.add_attachment() is broken.

## Expected Outcomes

### After Implementation
- **Comments**: Continue working (already functional due to ADF fix)
- **Attachments**: Resolve from 0% to 100% success rate
- **Overall System**: Achieve full functionality for both core operations

### Success Metrics
- HTTP 415 errors eliminated for attachment uploads
- Multipart/form-data properly set by requests library
- File attachments successfully uploaded to Jira issues
- No regression in comment functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Apply the one-line Content-Type header fix to `add_attachment()` method
2. **Validation**: Test attachment upload functionality
3. **Quality Assurance**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation about the fix

## Notes for Continuation

- The sophisticated ADF infrastructure is working correctly and doesn't need changes
- Only one critical bug remains: the Content-Type header conflict in file uploads
- The fix is simple but crucial: override the conflicting JSON content type for multipart uploads
- All analysis indicates this single change will resolve the remaining 0% failure rate for attachments
