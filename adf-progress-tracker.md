## Current Blockers

**None** - Ready to proceed with implementation

## Recent Accomplishments

**July 29, 2025:**
- ✅ Completed comprehensive planning using Zen MCP planner
- ✅ Created detailed 8-step implementation plan
- ✅ Researched ADF specification and existing conversion libraries
- ✅ Designed hybrid architecture approach
- ✅ Established success criteria and risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Created project documentation structure

## Upcoming Priorities

**Next Week:**
1. Begin Step 4: Create basic ADF generator prototype
2. Implement core markdown element support (bold, italic, paragraphs)
3. Test ADF generation against real Jira Cloud API
4. Validate deployment detection approach

**Following Week:**
1. Complete ADF generator implementation
2. Begin preprocessing pipeline integration
3. Create format router with deployment detection
4. Initial integration testing

## Performance Metrics

**Target Goals:**
- ADF conversion time: <100ms per conversion
- Format conversion success rate: >99%
- Deployment detection accuracy: 100%
- Zero breaking changes to Server/DC functionality

**Current Status:**
- Metrics collection framework: Not implemented
- Baseline measurements: Pending implementation
- Performance monitoring: Not configured

## Key Files Modified/Created

**Planning Phase:**
- ✅ adf-implementation-plan.md (Created)
- ✅ adf-progress-tracker.md (Created)
- ✅ mcp-atlassian-formatting-issues-guide.md (Reference document)

**Implementation Phase (Pending):**
- ⏳ src/mcp_atlassian/formatting/adf.py (To be created)
- ⏳ src/mcp_atlassian/formatting/router.py (To be created)
- ⏳ src/mcp_atlassian/formatting/__init__.py (To be created)
- ⏳ src/mcp_atlassian/preprocessing/jira.py (To be modified)
- ⏳ src/mcp_atlassian/preprocessing/confluence.py (To be modified)

## Decision Log

**July 29, 2025:**
- **Decision**: Use hybrid approach (ADF for Cloud, wiki for Server/DC)
- **Rationale**: Maintains backward compatibility while solving Cloud formatting issues
- **Impact**: Increased complexity but reduced risk

- **Decision**: Implement Python-native ADF generator vs JavaScript integration
- **Rationale**: Better integration, no external dependencies, full control
- **Impact**: More development effort but cleaner architecture

- **Decision**: Progressive element support (basic first, complex later)
- **Rationale**: Allows early validation and reduces implementation risk
- **Impact**: Longer development timeline but more reliable delivery

## Notes

- Repository memory system will be implemented to guide future Claude Code instances
- All documentation will be kept current throughout implementation
- Progress tracker to be updated after each completed task
- Success criteria validation planned for each phase completion
