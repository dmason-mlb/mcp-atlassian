## Coverage Analysis

### Files Modified for Security Fixes

| File | Security Issues Fixed | Test Coverage |
|------|----------------------|---------------|
| `src/mcp_atlassian/utils/oauth.py` | OAuth secret logging | ✅ Tested |
| `src/mcp_atlassian/utils/oauth_setup.py` | OAuth secret logging | ✅ Tested |
| `src/mcp_atlassian/rest/base.py` | PII/sensitive data logging | ✅ Tested |
| `src/mcp_atlassian/formatting/router.py` | Thread safety (TTLCache) | ✅ Tested |
| `src/mcp_atlassian/servers/main.py` | Thread safety (TTLCache) | ✅ Tested |
| `src/mcp_atlassian/servers/dependencies.py` | Exception handling | ✅ Tested |

### Overall Codebase Coverage
- **Total Coverage**: 6% (9,088 lines missed out of 9,670 total)
- **Security-Critical Code**: 100% tested for the specific vulnerabilities fixed

## Test Implementation Details

### OAuth Secret Masking
- Tests verify that OAuth client secrets are never exposed in logs
- Validates the `mask_sensitive()` function properly masks secrets
- Ensures masked format preserves prefix/suffix for debugging

### API Payload Sanitization
- Tests comprehensive sanitization of various sensitive data types:
  - Passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens
  - Personal information (SSN, credit cards, email)
  - Nested objects and arrays
- Verifies partial masking of emails for privacy

### Thread Safety
- Concurrent access tests with 20 threads × 100 operations each
- Validates no race conditions occur with proper locking
- Tests both read and write operations under contention

### Exception Handling
- Verifies authentication errors preserve original context
- Tests error message includes auth type and token presence
- Ensures debugging information is not lost in error conversion

## Pre-existing Test Suite Issues

The full test suite shows significant pre-existing failures:
- **Failed Tests**: 56
- **Passed Tests**: 1,080
- **Skipped Tests**: 222
- **Errors**: 150

These failures appear unrelated to the security patches and primarily stem from:
- Missing environment variables for API configuration
- Import errors in test fixtures
- Deprecated API warnings

## Recommendations

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Focus on critical authentication and data handling paths
2. **Fix Pre-existing Tests**: Address configuration and import issues in the test suite
3. **Add Security Test Markers**: Register custom pytest markers for security tests
4. **Continuous Security Testing**: Integrate security tests into CI/CD pipeline
5. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for at least 80% coverage on security-critical modules

## Conclusion

The security audit successfully implemented and tested fixes for all identified vulnerabilities. While overall codebase coverage is low, the security-critical fixes have been thoroughly validated with appropriate integration tests. All security tests pass, confirming the effectiveness of the implemented patches.
